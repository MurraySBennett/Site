## Cognitive Workload and Performance in Collaborative and Competitive Teams
### Does 1+1 = 2?
A shepherd is chasing down his escaped flock. The large flock means he struggles to control them all. Fortunately, his neighour joins him and together they set about herding the flock back to the field.

Does collaboration affect their performance for better or for worse?

## Competitive Group Decision Making
### Dutch Auctions

It is Valentines day again and you need to buy some flowers. You head down to the flower market where a *Dutch Auction* is underway. This particular type of auction is different. In a Dutch Auction the price of the item, in this case flowers, starts at some price then *increases* at set time intervals. The auction ends when the *first* bid is made and the winner takes home his flowers for the price at the time of the bid.
