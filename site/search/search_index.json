I study cognitive workload, performance, and decision making of individuals working in small collaborative and competitive groups. I use Python, Matlab, and R to develop mathematical tools and models to diagnose changes in the processing structure and efficiency of individual cognitive systems. I have also developed teaching materials for undergraduate students that include simple javascript cognitive psychgolgy experiments from visual search to reasoning tasks.

Fortunately, his neighour joins him and together they set about herding the flock back to the field. Does collaboration affect their performance for better or for worse?

You head down to the flower market where a Dutch Auction is underway. This particular type of auction is different. In a Dutch Auction the price of the item, in this case flowers, starts at some price then increases at set time intervals. The auction ends when the first bid is made and the winner takes home his flowers for the price at the time of the bid. Link to experiment analysis and code. Perceptual Choice There? or Thereabouts?
